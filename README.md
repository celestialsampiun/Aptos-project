# Betting Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Betting** smart contract provides a decentralized platform for users to place bets on real-world events. The outcome of the event is updated by an oracle, and winnings are distributed based on the result, ensuring transparency and fairness in betting.

## Features

- **Place Bet**:
  - Users can place bets on a specific outcome for a real-world event, with their wagers securely recorded on-chain.
- **Update Outcome**:
  - An oracle updates the event's outcome, and the contract is designed to handle the distribution of winnings based on the outcome.

## Future Scope

1. **Automated Payout Distribution**:

   - Implement logic to automatically calculate and distribute winnings to bettors after the outcome is finalized.

2. **Multiple Betting Options**:

   - Expand to support multiple betting options or more complex events with multiple possible outcomes.

3. **Decentralized Oracle Integration**:
   - Use decentralized oracles to verify event outcomes, ensuring the integrity of the betting process.

The **Betting** contract provides a secure and transparent way for users to place and resolve bets on real-world events, promoting fairness and decentralized participation.
